Chris Condreay - Bio
Hi (whomever) my name is Chris and I live in Simi Valley. Some things that I enjoy in life are 
taking photos (mostly of cars), watching videos of cars...I like cars LOL. I love watching anime as well 
though I haven't watched hundreds, yet. My current favorite animes are AOT, My Hero Acedamia, and JoJo.
I love playing games and want SO BADLY to upgrade so much on my computer. I have 3 dogs: 2 huskies 
(1 is a baby) and 1 lab; and one loves to pee in the house...can you guess which one (:(
I love going to the gym and being in shape and currently working on a healthy lifestyle.
