  <p>Hi (whomever) my name is Chris and I live in Simi Valley. Some things that I enjoy in life are taking photos (mostly of cars), watching videos of cars...I like cars LOL. I love watching anime as well</p>

  <p>(1 is a baby) and 1 lab; and one loves to pee in the house...can you guess which one (:( I love going to the gym and being in shape and currently working on a healthy lifestyle.</p>
